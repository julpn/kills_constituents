        <p>This site was developed by a small group of private citizens to hold Representatives accountable for voting for a disastrous healthcare bill.</p>

        <p>The 217 members of Congress who voted for the AHCA did not act like lives were at stake. They voted on the bill without even waiting for a report on its effects, and celebrated at the White House with a keg party. We decided to channel our anger into a message that conveyed a simple truth: every one of these politicians had voted to kill the people they represented.</p>

        <p>The numbers you see above are not exaggerated. The insurance numbers come from the Congressional Budget Office (the CBO) itself, and economists at the Center for American Progress broke them down on a district-by-district level using hospital data and Medicaid rolls.  We converted those numbers of uninsured to expected deaths using a 2014 study by The Annals of Internal Medicine, which was considered the most accurate of several studies on the subject (another commonly cited study would estimate almost twice as many deaths). For the costs for pre-existing conditions, we used a report from the AARP (for three states where they didn't have a precise estimate, we used the national average).</p>

        <p>Our hope is that this bill never becomes law. But no matter what happens, these reps should be held responsible for what they were willing to do to their constituents, and to all the people of the United States.</p>
